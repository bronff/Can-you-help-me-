Lock = Overlap of unprofitable positions at the expense of the profit of others

In this mode, the EA finds the most unprofitable long/short positions and tries to close them at the expense of the profit of other open positions. The overlap occurs on a counter, so in this case we also win a part of the spread.Buy Sell â€“ choose which positions we are trying to close

The EA will close a long order and all profit orders if its loss is covered by profit orders plus CloseProfit in the name of the deposit.

Remote order is determined by the distance from the current price to the order.

Example:

We have 20 positions open, of which 3 are in profit and 17 are in loss. The loss of the farthest order is 5 USD and the profit of all (3) profitable orders is 6 USD. If CloseProfit = 1 usd (5=6-1), then we will close long-term unprofitable and all profitable ones on the current currency pair. Next, the Expert Advisor again determines a pair of unprofitable ones and waits for the profit from new orders to continue working.
